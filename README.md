# King-County-Homes-Sales
An overview of home sales in King County, Washington.

This is another end-to-end project that I learned how to make while 
improving my craft. I discovered this from a YouTuber named Mo Chen, and 
I wanted to know how to create such a masterful piece.

## The Dashboard

Below is the dashboard containing all of the information of home sales in King County 
Washington form May, 2024 - May, 2015. The bar on the left includes an option to select 
a specific month, as well as the year the home was built, Sqft of Living Space, 
and Sqft of the entire lot.

In addition, you'll notice there is a calander underneath the month selection bar. If you 
choose to, you can select a day on the calender and it will filter the other charts accordingly.
